In this workshop, you are tasked with designing a database for an apartment complex application. As a newly hired database engineer, your responsibilities include:

Survey: Interview 15 students to gather suggestions on desired functionalities for the apartment complex app.
User Stories: Create user stories based on the survey responses, using the format: As a <role>, I want <action>, so that <impact>.
Basic Features: Implement key features such as:

The report must be written in English and submitted in PDF format along with the documentation and code uploaded to a GitHub repository.

Execution:
Survey: 15 students were interviewed, and key suggestions included payment management, reservation of common spaces, and maintenance reporting in my case, i tried to get different answers for each student.
User Stories: Created user stories based on the survey responses, such as viewing apartment lists, making payments, reserving common areas, and receiving notifications.
