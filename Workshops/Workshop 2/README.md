ðŸ“‘ Overview
This repository contains the solutions and relational algebra expressions for Workshop No. 2. The goal of the workshop is to apply relational algebra concepts to extract meaningful information from an apartment management database. The dataset simulates a system for managing apartments, owners, and reservations.

The challenge focuses on writing relational algebra expressions and drawing result tables based on the database schema, as well as creating an ER (Entity-Relationship) diagram to visualize the structure.

ðŸ“‹ Requirements
The database consists of three main tables: Apartment, Owner, and Reservations, along with an additional table for PublicServices. The goal is to perform queries based on the following tasks:

Apartment Table: Queries about apartment numbers, owners, and areas.
Owner Table: Queries about owners based on age, number of children, and pets.
Reservations Table: Queries about apartment reservations for specific dates and common spaces.
Entity-Relationship Diagram: Create an ER diagram to show relationships between the tables.
